Several existing packages provide a more consistent interface to parallel
computation.

Landau's [drake](https://ropensci.github.io/drake/) provides task
parallelism similar to GNU make.

Bengstton's
[futures](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/future/index.html)
provides a mechanism for parallel asynchronous evaluation of R code
across different systems.

Bischl and Lang's
[parallelMap](https://cran.r-project.org/package=parallelMap) provides a
parallel version of `Map()` supporting different execution backends
including local, multicore, mpi and BatchJobs. The
[batchtools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=batchtools) package
supports HPC systems.

BÃ¶hringer's
[parallelize.dynamic](https://cran.r-project.org/package=parallelize.dynamic)
provides the `parallelize_call()` function to dynamically parallelize a
single function call.

Wang's [valor](https://github.com/wanghc78/valor) vectorizes `lapply` calls
into single function calls. In some sense this is the most related project,
because the main purpose of valor is to actually transform code.
