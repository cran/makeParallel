```{r setup, include = FALSE}

  collapse = TRUE,

```

```{R, eval = FALSE}

library(knitr)
opts_knit$set(eval=FALSE)

```

Skimming through what is here, I realize that what I really need is a more
systematic form of algebra rather than all these heuristics.

```{R}
library(autoparallel)

autoparallel("my_script.R")
```

This generates a parallel version of `my_script.R`.

Internally it takes the following steps:

1. Parses the file `my_script.R`
2. Converts R's AST into an intermediate representation (IR) that's more
   suitable for analysis
3. Statically analyzes the IR to detect the potential for parallelism
4. Detects the capabilities of the system
5. Combines the the static analysis with the system capabilities to produce
   an execution plan
6. Saves the generated plan into a file


# Internal Design Documentation

This document is not intended for users. It contains the following:

- design decisions
- TODO lists
- possible ideas and extensions


# TODO

Estimate more precisely the costs of serialization. Is it much cheaper
to do it directly vs using `mccollect()`?


# Ideas

Write a function to check if code is IO bound.

Are there cheaper ways to share read only copies of objects between
processes in R? There's `bigmemory`, but what about something a little more
generalized like the plasma object store?

Data analysis workflow where at first you're not sure what you want.

Idea: You could even work totally in the interpreter, and provide a
function such as `save_last_statement()`. This function would look through all
previous correct statements executed through the interpreter and use them
to create the minimal script necessary to reproduce that last statement.
The idea is that as you explore a data set you probably enter many more
statemenets than you actually need, because you're not sure at first what
you're after.

Idea: Can we load only columns of a `data.frame` with R's `load` / `save`
commands?

Idea: `remove_nse()` function to replace nonstandard evaluation with
equivalant standard evaluation call. Transforms `subset(mtcars, select = mpg)` into 
`mtcars[, "mpg", drop = FALSE]`

Idea: The idea of intrinsically useful statments keeps coming back. For
example, one may have `head(dframe)` written somewhere in the code. This
implies that all columns of `dframe` are needed. But it's likely the case
that one never actually needed that call to `head(dframe)`; it was just
being inspected interactively. Then it can be removed from the final
product. So this would be another useful preprocessing step. As it stands,
let's assume that this preprocessing has happened, so that all statements
are strictly necessary.

Idea: Transform code written with `%>%` into regular R saving intermediate
variables so that it can be debugged.

Is it possible to tell a priori if code uses the RNG? If we knew it didn't
I'd feel better about evaluating it on the workers in parallel.

Idea: Detecting the use of global variables inside functions and modifying
them. For example:
```
x = 10
f = function(y) y + x
```
This should become
```
x = 10
f = function(y, .x = x) y + .x
```

Idea: Computing the same things when they can't change. Here's a real
example:
```
y[f(x), 1] = y[f(x), 2]
```
This should become:
```
tmp = f(x)
y[tmp, 1] = y[tmp, 2]
rm(tmp)
```

More generally with the above two examples I can think of all kinds of ways
that R code could be improved if it was written quickly or by a novice. We
could do two things: identify things that might be mistakes, similar to
`pyflakes`, and offer to programmatically rewrite the code.

Idea: For the functions that parallelize things based on timings we could
have a "timeout" where if it takes over a certain threshold time to run the
whole script then we just stop and parallelize what we can from there.

Idea: Often we can tell statically which functions are being used, ie. `lm`
is actually `stats::lm`. A preprocessing step could identify all of these
and distinguish them. We have to be careful, since using `::` takes 2
orders of magnitude more time than a simple lookup of an object in the base
package. More generally I'm curious to know when it's safe to evaluate
simple literal code such as `c(1, 3)`.

# Assumptions

I may want to make some of the following assumptions, depending on
convenience.

Input in a canonical form. Have to say precisely what this means. For
example:

- `<-` is used for assignment rather than `=` or `assign`
- All statements in the program are necessary, in the sense that they lead
  to something with a side effect.
- Existing `for` loops are unavoidable, ie. they do something like
  iterative updates. Otherwise they should be `lapply` type calls.

This can probably be done through preprocessing.


# Transpile

_Transpile_ here refers to translating and changing code to make it more
efficient. Consider this simple script:

```{R, eval = FALSE}

d = read.csv("data.csv")

hist(d[, 1])

```

This script only uses the first column of `d`, which means that all the
other columns were unnecessary. If `data.csv` is sufficiently large then
this program will spend an excessive amount of time reading data that are
never used.

In general we'd like to do all the preprocessing as early as possible,
saving only what we need.

## Design

If external packages such as `data.table` are being used, can we preserve
these calls? This requires understanding the semantics of the library functions
to use. So we'd have to do it custom for every package that we depend on.
Unless these packages provide drop in replacement for the target
statements.

More generally we could keep the calls that read everything in and then
remove what we don't need immediately after. Call this the "general
approach" This helps with saving memory,
but probably won't help with performance otherwise. In other words, we
might see a difference if we're up against memory limits.

__Possible Use Cases__

- Reducing memory footprint
- Increasing speed
Or should I just pick one?  Only for reading data?  And should I just
depend on and tie myself to data.table?

Ideally I don't make this specific to data.table.

Suppose I take the general approach. In which cases will this help with
memory pressure? The goal is to avoid making copies of a large data frame.
I need to experiment to see exactly when this happens.

The experiment shows that the unused columns in a data frame will not be
copied. For a matrix they should be, but in my experience people are
more likely to use a subset of the columns of a data frame versus a matrix.

In the general case we read in the unused columns and then never copy them. 
The only way this can alleviate memory pressure is if the program meets the
following conditions:

1. Has enough memory to contain the whole object in the first place
2. Subsequently requires more memory than is available

This seems rare to me.


## Assumptions

Assume that column selections can be inferred by static code analysis. For
example, we can statically analyze the following:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
# Literals
mtcars[, 1L]
mtcars[, "mpg"]
mtcars$mpg

# Variables defined from literals. This use case requires
# constant propagation
cols = c("cyl", "disp")
mtcars[, cols]
```

While we cannot statically analyze these:
```{R, eval = FALSE}

# Computed columns
col = read.csv("something_external.csv")[1, 1]
mtcars[, col]

# Random columns
mtcars[, min(rpois(1, 1) + 1, ncol(mtcars))]
```

So we assume that column selection is a literal after constant
propagation.


## Design For Minimal Use Case

I'm going to start off getting something common and simple to work, and
then generalize from there. The example from the beginning is as simple as
possible.

```{R, eval = FALSE}

d = read.csv("data.csv")

hist(d[, 2])

```

This should be transformed to the following:

```{R, eval = FALSE}

d = data.table::fread("data.csv", select = 2)

hist(d[, 1])

```

__Basic Steps__ Necessary for the minimal use case to work

1. Infer that a data frame `d` is created by a call to `read.csv()`
2. Identify all calls which subset `d` and transform them into a common
   form.
4. Find `usedcolumns` the set of all columns which are used
5. Transform the `read.csv(...)` call into `data.table::fread(..., select =
   usedcolumns)`
6. Transform the calls which subset `d` into new indices.


__More Advanced__ Functionality going beyond the minimal use case. I'll
think about these once the basics are working.

Account for indirect use of variables. The following should infer that the
4th column is used.

```{R, eval = FALSE}
d = read.csv("data.csv")
d2 = d * 2
d2[, 4]
```

Verify the indices subsetting `d` can be computed at the time of
static analysis.

Check if any commands imply that the whole data set must be loaded. For
example:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
d = read.csv("data.csv")
d[, 5] = 2
write.csv(d, "data2.csv")  # Uses all columns of d
```

Read subsets without corresponding variable assignments, for example:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
hist(read.csv("data.csv")[, 2])
```

More complicated forms of assignment

```{R, eval = FALSE}
a = b = read.csv("data.csv")
```


## Implementation

How can we tell which columns are used?


Fri Sep 22 10:31:23 PDT 2017

For the moment I'm ignoring NSE such as `subset`.

Thinking now that it's fine to depend on `data.table`.
`data.table::fread` has a `select` parameter for column names. It would be
more convenient for our purposes here if `select` took an integer vector of
the column indices instead. Indices are more general because:

- Not every text file has column names
- Not every data frame has meaningful column names
- Column names may not be unique

One approach is to take all the uses of column names and map them into
integers.
The code will go through three representations then:

__Original__ including mixed names and integers:

```{R, eval = FALSE}

mpg = mtcars$mpg
cyl = mtcars[, 2]
disp = mtcars[, "disp"]
wt = mtcars[[5]]

```

__Name Replacement__ substitutes the names with integers, and converts all
`data.frame` subsetting commands into single `[`. Assume that we know the
column names.

```{R, eval = FALSE}

mpg = mtcars[, 1]
cyl = mtcars[, 2]
disp = mtcars[, 3]
wt = mtcars[, 5]

```

As we replace names we can update the set of variables which are used, so that
after processing all statements we know which are used.


__Subset mapping__ maps the original indices to corresponding indices in the
smaller `data.frame`. The index map is a sorted integer vector of the
columns that are used. This step cannot happen with the previous because
it's necessary to first know all the columns which will be used.

```{R, eval = FALSE}

index_map = c(1, 2, 3, 5)

# Suppose fread supports integers here
.mtcars = fread(..., select = index_map)

mpg = .mtcars[, 1]
cyl = .mtcars[, 2]
disp = .mtcars[, 3]
wt = .mtcars[, 4]   # This one changes

```

## Details

__Nested subsetting__

Suppose that `x` is the data frame of interest. Consider the following
reasonable code:

```
x[x[, "d"] > 10, "b"]
```

Replacing names gives us the following in standard form:

x[x[, 4] > 10, 2]

Because there is nested subsetting we need to respect the structure of the
parse tree to correctly substitute these variables with indices.

TODO: What is the issue in my mind? I don't want this to happen:
```
# First step updates the inner
x[x[, 4] > 10, "b"]

# Second step updates the outer based on the original statement
x[x[, "d"] > 10, 2]
```

This leaves us with the task of having to merge the parse trees. We
definitely want to avoid this. So we need to update the tree in place,
incrementally. In the more general case it may happen that the locations of
the parse tree change as it is modified.  Then we'll need a way to guarantee
that nothing is overwritten. Maybe applying the changes depth first?


__Algorithm For Code Modification__

The goal is to automate this to the greatest extent possible.
Here's the approach:

First preprocess the script.
- Single static assignment should be used so that variables aren't written
  over.
- Unnecessary statements should be removed.

Find every instance of the calls to be replaced, ie. `read.csv()` and
`read.table()`. These calls should return data frames.
For each call (referred to below as `readcall`) to be replaced, do the following:

1. Check that the output of the call is assigned to a variable. If not,
   then proceed to the next iteration. If so, then call that variable
   `var`.
2. Attempt to infer the column names for `var`. 
   1. First check if they are passed explicitly in the read call, ie.
      `read.table("data.txt", col.names = c("a", "b")).
   2. If the above fails, inject the argument `nrows = 1` into the call so
      that only 1 row is read. Attempt to evaluate the code and determine
      the column names.  
   3. If everything fails then record the column names as unknown.
2. Find all uses of `var` in the code following the assignment. 
3. Transform calls that subset `var` into a common form: `var[, i]` where
   `i` is an integer vector. If the column names remain unknown but are
   used to subset then raise an error.
4. Determine `index_map`, a vector representing the set of all columns
  of the data which were used
5. Transform `readcall` into something of the form `data.table::fread(...,
   select = index_map)`
5. Use `index_map` to map the code of the form `var[, i]` into `var[, i*]`
   representing a subset of the data frame.

  


## Limitations

What are the limitations of the approach that I've just outlined? 

It's really only designed for data frames. So it would be a little
dangerous if I _think_ something is a data frame, when in fact it's a list.
Then if I replace `[[` and `$` with `[` it won't work. I can get around
this by focusing on functions that return data frames, for example
`read.csv()`.

I haven't yet considered subsetting rows, there may be a way to do that
efficiently.  A common way is to subset based on the value of some column.
I could do this by keeping on open file pointer, reading a chunk of the
data, subset it, add that subset to a list, then rbind the subsets
together. This potentially lets R quickly process files larger than memory.

How to get every column which is used when new copies of the data frame
are created? For example:

```{R, eval = FALSE}

mtcars2 = mtcars[possible_subset, ]

# Now `gear` column must be read in.
mtcars2$gear

```

Stepping back, R has many ways to write programs. To simplify tasks here we
first put the code into a canonical form, and then do "surgery" on it.


# SNOW

forking is easier than SNOW clusters, since forked workers all
have a consistent, current state. 

Here's an R script:
```

code = parse(text = '
library(MASS)
start = 0
f = function(end) area(sin, start, end)
d = as.list(1:5)
lapply(d, f)
')

# Experimenting
autoparallel:::snow_fork(code)

```
It's not sufficient to substitute `parallel::parLapply` in for `lapply`,
because the workers will not load the `MASS` library or have the `start`
variable. The following works:

```{R, eval = FALSE}

library(parallel)
cl = makeCluster(2L)

code = parse(text = "
library(MASS)
start = 0
f = function(end) area(sin, start, end)
")

eval(code)
clusterCall(cl, eval, code, .GlobalEnv)

d = as.list(1:5)

out = parLapply(cl, d, f)

# Check that it's the same:
all.equal(out, lapply(d, f))

```

This suggests the approach of evaluating all code before we reach the `lapply`
statement. We need several assumptions about the code:
1. It's necessary to run
2. It will do the same thing on each worker (not the case for random things)
3. It won't take so long to run that we lose the subsequent benefit of
  parallelism.

We can probably check the first two conditions. It's not easy to know how
long it will take the whole thing to run though.

## Side Notes


info = lapply(code, CodeDepends::getInputs)

# The CodeDepends output says when `read.csv` func is called, which is
# helpful. But it doesn't let me see if the result of `read.csv` is
# assigned to a variable, which is what I need.

code2 = quote(x <- rnorm(n = read.csv("data.csv")))

CodeDepends::getInputs(code2)
