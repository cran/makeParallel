Description: 
    Writing parallel R code can be difficult, particularly for code
    that is not "embarrassingly parallel".
    This experimental package automates the transformation of serial R code
    into more efficient parallel versions. It identifies task parallelism by
    statically analyzing entire scripts to detect dependencies between
    statements. It implements an extensible system for scheduling
    and generating new code. It includes a reference implementation of the
    'List Scheduling' approach to the general task scheduling problem of scheduling 
    statements on multiple processors.
